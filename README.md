# FlappyPegasus
BY Samrath, Shivom, CJ, and Callister  
A funny Beyblade themed spinoff (lol) of the original hit, FlappyBird.
# Prerequisites
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYGAME INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER.  
YOU WILL GET AN ERROR WHEN TRYING TO RUN THE CODE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PYGAME INSTALLED.  
# How To Play
It's just like FlappyBird. To start playing, just tap your spacebar, or press the up arrow key on your keyboard.  
You will be faced with pipes from the top and bottom of the screen, and your goal is to maneuver Pegasus through the pipes using only the up and down movement the game offers.  
If you happen to hit the ground, pipes, or the top of the screen, the game will make an audible sound to let you know. The game will also pause. (To restart, just tap either the spacebar or up arrow.)
